Notes on individual issues:
===========================

tools/javac:

JDK-8341779: [REDO BACKPORT] type annotations are not visible to javac plugins across compilation boundaries (JDK-8225377)
==========================================================================================================================
The compiler in previous releases of OpenJDK 21 would only provide
access to type annotations on types loaded from source code files.  If
the type was instead loaded from bytecode, then any type annotations
would be absent.

With this release, `TypeMirror` now provides access to annotations for
types loaded from bytecode.  These type annotations can be obtained
using `AnnotationMirror#getAnnotationMirrors` and will be included in
the output of `AnnotationMirror#toString`.

Programs that rely on type annotations being absent from elements
loaded from bytecode will need to be updated accordingly. Due to
ongoing issues with this new feature (see JDK-8360406), it is not
enabled by default and the option `-XDaddTypeAnnotationsToSymbol=true`
must be specified in order for bytecode type annotations to be
included.

core-libs/java.net:

JDK-8342075: HttpClient: improve HTTP/2 flow control checks
===========================================================
This release of OpenJDK 21 enhances the HTTP/2 client implementation
in `java.net.http.HttpClient` to report flow control errors back to
the server. While this should be transparent in most cases, it may
lead to streams being reset or connections being closed if connecting
to a HTTP/2 server that does not correctly handle these errors.

Flow control limits can be adjusted using the following existing
properties:

* `jdk.httpclient.connectionWindowSize`
  - Specifies the HTTP/2 client connection window size in bytes.
  - Default value: `2^26`
  - Range: `2^16-1` to `2^31-1`.

* `jdk.httpclient.windowSize`
  - Specifies the HTTP/2 client stream window size in bytes.
  - Default value: `16777216` (16MB)
  - Range: `2^14` to `2^31-1`

Specifying an invalid value leads to the default value being used.
The implementation guarantees that the actual value used for the
connection window size will be no smaller than the stream window size.

hotspot/runtime:

JDK-8318636: Add jcmd to print annotated process memory map
===========================================================
Two new diagnostic commands have been added to `jcmd`, which print the
virtual memory map of the JVM either to standard output or a file.  If
Native Memory Tracking (NMT) is enabled, NMT information about the
virtual memory segments will be included.

The new commands are:

* `jcmd <pid> System.map` -- prints the virtual memory map of the JVM
identified by `<pid>` to the standard output.

* `jcmd <pid> System.dump_map` -- prints the virtual memory map of the
JVM identified by `<pid>` to a file `vm_memory_map_<pid>.txt` in the
current directory.

security-libs/java.security:

JDK-8303770: Remove Baltimore root certificate expiring in May 2025
===================================================================
The following root certificate from Baltimore has been removed from
the `cacerts` keystore:

Alias Name: baltimorecybertrustca [jdk]
Distinguished Name: CN=Baltimore CyberTrust Root, OU=CyberTrust, O=Baltimore, C=IE

JDK-8347506: Compatible OCSP readtimeout property with OCSP timeout
===================================================================
The initial release of OpenJDK 21 introduced the
`com.sun.security.ocsp.readtimeout` property, which was paired with
the existing `com.sun.security.ocsp.timeout` to give greater control
over the timeouts for OCSP connections and certificate retrieval. The
existence of two separate properties allows the timeout for reading
data to be set separately from the timeout for the transport layer.

When `com.sun.security.ocsp.readtimeout` was backported to OpenJDK
17.0.15, the default value of `com.sun.security.ocsp.readtimeout` was
changed from 15 seconds to the value of
`com.sun.security.ocsp.timeout`, which itself has a default of 15
seconds.  This change is brought forward to OpenJDK 21 with this
release.

If neither property is set, both will default to 15 seconds as in
previous OpenJDK 21 releases.  If only `com.sun.security.ocsp.timeout`
is set, `com.sun.security.ocsp.readtimeout` will use the same value
which retains the behaviour from before the
`com.sun.security.ocsp.readtimeout` property was introduced.

JDK-8347596: Update HSS/LMS public key encoding
===============================================
The X.509 encoding format for HSS/LMS public keys has been updated to
align with the latest standard outlined in RFC 9708 [0].  Notably, the
OCTET_STRING wrapping around the public key value has been removed.
For compatibility, the JDK will still detect the presence of DER
encoding when reading keys encoded by earlier releases.

JDK-8350498: Remove two Camerfirma root CA certificates
=======================================================
The following expired root certificates from Camerfirma have been
removed from the `cacerts` keystore:

JDK-8359170: Add 2 TLS and 2 CS Sectigo roots
=============================================
The following root certificates have been added to the cacerts
truststore:

Name: Sectigo Limited
Alias Name: sectigocodesignroote46
Distinguished Name: CN=Sectigo Public Code Signing Root E46, O=Sectigo Limited, C=GB
