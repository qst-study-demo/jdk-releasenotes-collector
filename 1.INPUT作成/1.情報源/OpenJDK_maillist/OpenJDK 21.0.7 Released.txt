Notes on individual issues:
===========================

security-libs/java.security:

JDK-8309841: Jarsigner should print a warning if an entry is removed
====================================================================
In previous OpenJDK releases, the jarsigner tool did not detect the
case where a file was removed from a signed JAR file but its signature
was still present. With this release, `jarsigner -verify` checks that
every signature has a matching file entry and prints a warning if this
is not the case. The `-verbose` option can also be added to the
command to see the names of the mismatched entries.

security-libs/javax.net.ssl:

JDK-8346587: Distrust TLS server certificates anchored by Camerfirma Root CAs
=============================================================================
In accordance with similar plans recently announced by Google,
Mozilla, Apple and Microsoft, the JDK will not trust Transport Layer
Security (TLS) certificates issued after the 15th of April 2025 which
are anchored by Camerfirma root certificates.

Certificates issued on or before April 15th, 2025 will continue to
be trusted until they expire.

If a server's certificate chain is anchored by an affected
certificate, attempts to negotiate a TLS session will fail with an
Exception that indicates the trust anchor is not trusted. For example,

"TLS server certificate issued after 2025-04-15 and anchored by a
distrusted legacy Camerfirma root CA: CN=Chambers of Commerce Root -
2008, O=AC Camerfirma S.A., SERIALNUMBER=A82743287, L=Madrid (see
current address at www.camerfirma.com/address), C=EU"

To check whether a certificate in a JDK keystore is affected by this
change, you can the `keytool` utility:

keytool -v -list -alias <your_server_alias> -keystore <your_keystore_filename>

If any of the certificates in the chain are affected by this change,
then you will need to update the certificate or contact the
organisation responsible for managing the certificate.

These restrictions apply to the following Camerfirma root certificates
included in the JDK:

Alias name: camerfirmachamberscommerceca [jdk]
CN=Chambers of Commerce Root
OU=http://www.chambersign.org
O=AC Camerfirma SA CIF A82743287
C=EU

Users can, *at their own risk*, remove this restriction by modifying
the `java.security` configuration file (or override it by using the
`java.security.properties` system property) so "CAMERFIRMA_TLS" is no
longer listed in the `jdk.security.caDistrustPolicies` security
property.

JDK-8293345: SunPKCS11 provider checks on PKCS11 Mechanism are problematic
==========================================================================
In OpenJDK 14, the notion of legacy mechanisms was introduced into the
SunPKCS11 provider.  If a mechanism was found to be using a weak
algorithm, it was determined to be legacy and disabled.

However, this approach has proved inflexible. There was no way for the
user to override the legacy determination and enable the mechanism
anyway.  Also, a mechanism being used for signing would be declared
legacy and disabled if it had a weak encryption algorithm, even though
encryption was not being used. Similarly, a weak signing algorithm
would prevent the mechanism's use as a cipher for encryption or
decryption.

This OpenJDK release resolves these issues. It introduces the PKCS11
provider configuration attribute "allowLegacy" which can be set to
`true` if the user wishes to override the legacy determination. By
default, it is set to `false`. The legacy determination now also
considers the service type and will only check encryption algorithms
for Ciphers and only signature algorithms for Signatures.
