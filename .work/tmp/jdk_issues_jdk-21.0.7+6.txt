Title: [JDK-8348625] [21u, 17u] Revert JDK-8185862 to restore old java.awt.headless behavior on Windows
Description:
JDK-8185862 changed the detection of headless mode on Windows by enumerating displays and turning on headless mode when only virtual devices exist. This causes problems with several use cases, mostly for automatic testing, e.g. JDK-8336862, JDK-8340992, JDK-8341294.

While the new detection mode seems correct from its idea, we should revert the change for the current LTS update releases and try to focus on fixing issues with explicitly using -Djava.awt.headless=true in the head release.

Title: [JDK-8325851] Hide PassFailJFrame.Builder constructor
Description:
The PassFailJFrame.Builder class provides a way to configure the parameters of PassFailJFrame in a set of chained method calls.

The Builder class is public and has public constructor. At the same time, a better design would be to hide all the Builder constructors and rely on the builder() method which returns an instance of the Builder.

At the same time, the builder() helper wasn't available until JDK-8294156 which was integrated in October 2023 whereas the Builder class became available with JDK-8294535 in August 2023.

For this reason, there are 20 tests which create the PassFailJFrame.Builder object using its constructor instead of the helper method. These tests have to be updated.

To find these tests, run:

grep -r 'new PassFailJFrame.Builder' test/jdk

Hiding the PassFailJFrame.Builder constructor is a better design choice. New tests should not create the builder using the `new` keyword. To enforce it, the Builder constructor needs to be private.

Ref build log: https://ci.adoptium.net/job/build-scripts/job/jobs/job/jdk21u/job/jdk21u-aix-ppc64-temurin/88/consoleFull

I suspect recent change: JDK-8327460

may be the cause? Not sure AIX jtreg test code links with -qvisibility=hidden

possibly??

Description:
The zone.tab file was removed by JDK-8166983 in trunk and so was not updated as part of the original version of JDK-8347965.

While the 24u backport did update zone.tab, the 21u backport - and subsequent backports to 17u, 11u & 8u based on this - did not,due to being based on the trunk backport.

We should apply the zone.tab update to the 2025a updates in the upcoming April releases. Long-term, we should look at the possibility of backporting JDK-8166983 as tzdata is frequently updated and these files only in older JDK releases are likely to be missed.

Description:
Try to recover and output meaningful information in more situations, such as:

- when a pointer is in Method metadata memory range, but the memory is not committed

- when we call a bad address

When calling a bad address, we usually don't get a meaningful stack backtrace, but in many situations we can if we know where to find the caller information.

Description:
Backout the backport of 8337994 to 21u.

We see failures of test/jdk/jdk/jfr/jvm/TestChunkIntegrity.java with slowdebug and fastdebug builds.

The failure is well reproducible with the slowdebug build, but with faster binaries the test passes sometimes.

In our nightly CI with high load the fastdebug build fails reliably.

From the .jtr file of the testruns:

Title: [JDK-8284620] CodeBuffer may leak _overflow_arena
Description:
CodeBuffer is declared as StackObj, but it also has ResourceObj style new operator, to complicate thing further more, it has _overflow_arena that is C Heap allocated.

When Stack allocated CodeBuffer owns _overflow_arena, it works fine, because its destructor frees _overflow_arena. But if resource allocated CodeBuffer owns _overflow_arena, the arena is leaked, because its destructor is never called.
